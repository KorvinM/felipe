## Front End Ligature Interpolating PHP Envelope

Provides a very simple and just good enough base for prototyping PHP applications.

Wraps up a front end based on HTML5bp in PHP.
It bundles normalize.css, jQuery and Modernizr as per HTML5bp.

Try to build anything too complex with this and it would probably break.
For example there's no way to create nested directories of pages. All views would have to be in the root. TODO: fix this.

When I'm learning to build something fairly simple I like to have a ready-made testing environment that enables me to test out server-side PHP as well as front end code.
This is it. A simple tool to help me mess about with vanilla, framework-less code without having to build a new front end every time.
