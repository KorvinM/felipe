## Front End Ligature Interpolating PHP Envelope

Provides a very simple and just good enough base for prototyping and learning.

Wraps up a front end based on HTML5bp in PHP.
It bundles jQuery and Modernizr as per HTML5bp. Stylesheets normalize.css and main.css are adapted from the HTML5bp versions as per my preferences.

Try to build anything too complex with this and it would probably break.
For example there's no way to create nested directories of pages. All views would have to be in the root. TODO: fix this.

When I'm learning to build something fairly simple I like to have a ready-made starter kit.
This is it. A simple tool to help me avoid building a new front end every time.
