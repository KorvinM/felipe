      This, a workbook of basic JavaScript learning, comprises some
      simple projects demonstrating ways of using functions, variables, arrays, control
      statements, and DOM manipulation.
    <p>
      We'll also cover some distinctions of modern Javascript, then dive deeper,
      looking at objects, classes and modules, and finish with some more advanced
      projects demonstrating asynchronous operations with HTTP requests.
    <p>
      Source code is included with each program, along with other illustrative
      code examples, snippets, and notes.
