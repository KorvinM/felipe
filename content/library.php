<h2>Library</h2>

<pre data-src = "js/library.js"></pre>
<p>Ideas to build on this:
<ul><li> 
    Add more properties to each class (movieCast, songTitles, etc.)</li>
    <li>Create a CD class that extends Media.</li>
    <li>In .addRating(), make sure input is between 1 and 5.</li>
    <li>Create a method called shuffle for the CD class. The method returns a randomly sorted array of all the songs in the songs property.</li>
    <li>Create class called Catalog that holds all of the Media items in our library.</li>
</ul>
<h2>School Catalogue</h2>
<pre data-src = "js/School.js"></pre>
<p>Ideas to extend this
<ul><li>
    Add more properties to each class (averageTestScores, schoolOverview, etc.)</li>
    <li>Create a class called SchoolCatalog that holds a collection of schools. Create an instance of SchoolCatalog for primary, middle, and high schools.</li>
</ul>
